- [ ] Install a UI component via npm package
- [ ] Frontend unit test framework applied
- [ ] Put the code on GitHub and use a proper README file
- [ ] An app user should be able to favorite a friend and starred friends should persist across page refreshes

- [ ] Deploy the app online (e.g. to GitHub pages or Netlify), and make sure the project's README or description has a link to the live app.

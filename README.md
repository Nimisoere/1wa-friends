# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Requirements

Hiya ðŸ‘‹ Frontend whizz! ðŸ˜Š

Thanks for your interest in the front end Engineer position with 1WA.
We have put together a quick exercise to test your amazing React skills, experience and use of best practices.

You are to implement the following in React:

[x] Use a friendsList.json file to stores all the friends

[x] Ensure your components are reusable

[x] Use TypeScript (type everything typable)

[x] Use React hooks to load up the friends data

[x] Ensure the application is responsive across form factors

[] Add a language localization switcher with 2 languages on app header

[x] Install a UI component via npm package

[] Frontend unit test framework applied

[] Put the code on GitHub and use a proper README file

[] An app user should be able to favorite a friend and starred friends should persist across page refreshes

[] When the app user clicks on a particular friend, it should display the friend in a friend-details page/view. Feel free to come up with the look and feel of the friend-details page.

[] Deploy the app online (e.g. to GitHub pages or Netlify), and make sure the project's README or description has a link to the live app.

[x] Integrate Codacy to the repository and attain a code quality rating of B and above

[] Your app should score 85% and above on all four areas evaluated on https://web.dev/measure (i.e Performance, Best Practices, Accessibility, & SEO)
Alert in the compiler if the app bundle is over 300K in size
